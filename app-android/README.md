# app-android — the capture instrument

The Android app that turns the phone into the measurement instrument (handoff §5: "Phone =
the instrument"). It captures sensor data, runs the archery module + engine **on-device**, and
shows live + post-session feedback in the Hyle design language.

> **Not yet in the Gradle build.** This module needs the Android Gradle Plugin + Android SDK,
> which aren't available in the headless CI used for `archery-module`. Add
> `include(":app-android")` to the root `settings.gradle.kts` and create `app-android/build.gradle.kts`
> with the AGP once you're building on a machine with the Android SDK. The headless,
> hardware-independent logic already lives — and is tested — in `archery-module`; this module is
> the thin capture/UI shell on top of it.

## Dependencies (pin at build time, handoff §6)

| Concern | Library |
|---|---|
| UI | Jetpack Compose (native Kotlin), Hyle design tokens |
| Camera/pose | CameraX + MediaPipe Pose / BlazePose (GHUM) |
| Phone IMU | `SensorManager` (`TYPE_GYROSCOPE`, `TYPE_ACCELEROMETER`, `TYPE_ROTATION_VECTOR`), `SENSOR_DELAY_FASTEST` |
| BLE (A1 Pro / external IMU) | Nordic Android-BLE-Library; nRF Connect for discovery |
| Storage | Room/SQLite (raw windows + reps + sessions) |
| Engine | this repo's `:engine` + `:archery-module` modules (no external dependency) |

## MVP screen flow (handoff §11 first build target)

1. **Session setup** — pick athlete, enter bow/draw-weight (the known load for inverse statics).
2. **Live capture** — bow-mounted phone IMU streams; live steadiness + cant readout during the
   hold; provenance-glow = radium-green (on-device inference).
3. **Per-shot card** — after the release spike, show segmented phases + the shot's features and
   per-shot deviation vs baseline; prompt for **manual arrow score**.
4. **Baseline build** — mark good shots; the engine's `BaselineBuilder` firms up "your good"
   (shows N/8 until ready).
5. **Session review** — stability trend across shots, **fatigue** (steadiness decay), and a
   first **signal-vs-score scatter** from `SignalScoreCorrelation`.

## Capture → module → engine wiring (illustrative)

The hardware-touching code is thin; everything below the `TimeSeries` boundary is already
implemented and tested in `:archery-module` and `baseline-engine`.

```kotlin
// 1. Collect a bow-IMU window from SensorManager into the engine's TimeSeries.
//    channels MUST be ArcheryChannels.{GYRO_*, ACC_*}; gyro in deg/s, accel in g.
val window: TimeSeries = imuRecorder.toTimeSeries()   // app-owned (SensorManager)

// 2. Segment + extract — pure module code, no Android types.
val shots = ArcheryModule.segmenter.segment(window)
val features = shots.map { ArcheryModule.extractor.extract(it) }

// 3. (optional) add strength features from a sagittal pose frame at full draw.
val moments = InverseStatics.analyze(pose, drawForceN, stringDir, athleteBodyMassKg)
val shotFeatures = features.last() + moments.asFeatures()

// 4. Score against the athlete's baseline (engine).
val deviation = DeviationScorer(baseline, ArcheryModule.deviationWeights).score(shotFeatures)
//    deviation.stability -> the 0..100 the archer watches; deviation.topDeviation -> the diagnosis

// 5. After logging arrow scores, surface the differentiator.
val relations = SignalScoreCorrelation.correlate(session.reps)  // "this drift costs you ~X points"
```

## On-device validation plan (handoff §4b)

Run the Steady Aim A1 Pro's own app side-by-side and compare our `steadiness` / `pinDriftDeg` /
phase segmentation against its USA-Archery-grade numbers. Tune `SegmenterConfig` and
`STEADINESS_SCALE_DEG_PER_S` until they track. Only then pursue reverse-engineering the A1 Pro
GATT profile to fold it in as a first-class sensor (§4a).
